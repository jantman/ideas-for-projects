Recipe Share / Shopping List Site
=================================

- upload your recipes. They're stored in a structured format (especially
  ingredients, with structure for every possible
  type/variant/preparation/etc., but also steps including actual prep time for
  each step)
- search everyone else's recipes
- input everything in your pantry, along with an appropriate amount
- app to pair with this, mainly for the next bits
- select some recipes, generate a shopping list of what you NEED (i.e. what
  ingredients the recipes require that aren't already in your pantry, or that
  you don't already have enough of). Can check off items as you get them.
- select an ingredient and see the recipes (optionally, ones that you've
  made/rated/whatever before) that you can make with it
- recipes have "rare" ingredients marked. you can see a list of them, so you
  know to get them if you happen to find them. when you do, it adds whatever
  else you need for the recipe to your current shopping list.
- of course, this should be made from the start with families/couples shopping
  together or separate in mind. that means actual, quick syncronization, or an
  app that's just a wrapper around a mobile site. but we also want the list
  available offline.
