ideas-for-projects
==================

[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

Various ideas I've had for different projects, which I haven't started yet.

Feel free to take these and use them so long as:

1.  The code you write is open source (OSI-approved license, and actually released)
2.  If you're offering it as a paid service, you offer what's outlined in my idea at no cost to anyone who wants it. No membership fee, no crippled features, no "take 10 surveys to use this", no "invite 10 friends to use this". At most, "enter your email address and a password, and answer this CAPTCHA".
3.  Users have a platform-independent way of getting out ALL of their data in a documented, machine-readable, standardized format (read: this means something like JSON, YAML, or if you want to kill some kittens, XML. Not some binary crap.)
